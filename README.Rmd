# DualProbitCDF Repository
<!--**DUA**l probit marginal **L**ikelihood **E**stimation via **EP** **A**pproximation, -->

[![Last Commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/fradenti/EPmvnCDF)](https://github.com/fradenti/EPmvnCDF)

The repository **DualProbitCDF** contains the R package and code implementing the estimation strategy proposed in the article:

> *“Multivariate Gaussian cumulative distribution functions as the marginal likelihood of their dual Bayesian probit model”*
> by A. Fasano and F. Denti, published in **Biometrika (2025)**.

In addition to the package itself, the repository includes all the scripts needed to reproduce the simulation studies and the figures presented in the paper.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the R Project**  
   Open the R project file `DualProbitCDF.Rproj` and set it as your working directory.

2. **Install the R Package**  
   Install the included R package `EPmvnCDF`, which stands for  
   *Expectation Propagation for the estimation of Multivariate Normal Cumulative Distribution Functions*, via
   ```r
   install.packages("EPmvnCDF_0.1.0.tar.gz", type = "source")
   ```

   Otheror open the `R` project contained in the `EPmvnCDF/` folder and build it from there.

Then you can run the code.

In particular:

- Scripts starting with the letter **`A`** contain utility functions that are reused throughout the project.

- Scripts starting with the letter **`B`** contain the code to run the four estimation methods described in the main paper:
  - our **Expectation Propagation (EP)** proposal, implemented using both Cholesky and Eigenvalue decompositions;
  - the **`TruncatedNormal`** package;
  - the **`tlrmvnmvt`** package;
  - the **Orthant method** by Ridgway (2016), implemented in **C++** (see the `cpp_source/` directory).

  The output of each method is stored in the corresponding subfolder within the `RDS/` directory.

- The `.Rmd` file starting with the letter **`C`** extracts and processes the simulation results stored in the `.RDS` files. It creates summary data frames (saved in `RDS/`) and saves the figures used in the paper.

- Scripts starting with the letter **`D`** reproduce an additional simulation study included in the Supplementary Material.
